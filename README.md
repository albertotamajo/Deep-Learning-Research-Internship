# Deep-Learning-Research-Internship
- Conducted literature research on Geometric Deep Learning, Generative Adversarial Networks and Variational AutoEncoders for point cloud encoding and generation
- Proposed two novel graph convolutional neural network and adjacency matrixoperations, named Shrinking Layer and Stack Shrinking Layer, capable of exploring self-correlations, local-correlations and non-local correlations betweenpoints for the encoding of point clouds
- Implemented the proposed architectures and their training procedures usingthe Pytorch and Pytorch Geometric libraries. The implementation supports multi-GPU utilisation on cluster computing 
- Employed the Stack Extending Layer in a neural network architecture for pointcloud classification tasks achieving an outstanding 91.25% accuracy on the ModelNet10 dataset. This work might result in a publication together with Dr.Bastian Pla√ü
